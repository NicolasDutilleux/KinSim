# KinSim: PacBio Kinetic Signal Simulator for Metagenomics

## 📌 Project Context
This project is developed as part of a Master's internship in Bioinformatics. It addresses the lack of simulation tools for **PacBio HiFi** sequencing data that include epigenetic information. 

Single-Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing detects DNA modifications (methylation) via variations in polymerase speed, measured through **IPD** (Inter-Pulse Duration) and **PW** (Pulse Width) tags. These signatures are species-specific and serve as a powerful lever for **metagenomic binning**.

## 🚀 The KinSim Objective
KinSim is designed to inject realistic kinetic signals into "naked" reads generated by **PBSIM3**. 

The workflow consists of three key stages:
1. **Base Simulation**: Generating raw reads from reference genomes using PBSIM3.
2. **Motif Identification**: Scanning sequences for methylation sites (6mA, 4mC, 5mC) identified in the **REBASE** database.
3. **AI-Driven Generation**: Utilizing a Machine Learning model (cGAN or Transformer architecture) to predict and inject IPD/PW values based on local context (k-mers).

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Language**: Python 3.10+
* **Bioinformatics**: PBSIM3, Pysam, Biopython, REBASE
* **Deep Learning**: PyTorch (GPU/Colab training)
* **Design**: Figma for system architecture and data flow diagrams

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `src/`: Core source code (I/O, ML models, simulation logic).
* `data/`: (Excluded from Git) Genomic references and BAM files.
* `notebooks/`: Exploration and signal distribution analysis.
* `tests/`: Statistical validation of generated signals.
