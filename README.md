# KinSim
KinSim: PacBio Kinetic Signal Simulator. Injects realistic IPD/PW tags into PBSIM3 reads using REBASE motifs and Machine Learning. Designed to generate ground-truth datasets for methylation-aware metagenomic binning (e.g., SemiBin). Features: 6mA/4mC/5mC shifts, k-mer context awareness, and BAM enrichment.
